# Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying the Voting DApp to production.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
1. Completed the [Setup Guide](setup.md)
2. Created a Firebase project
3. Configured all environment variables
4. Tested the application locally

## Step 1: Build the Application

1. Build the client application:
```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

This will create a production-ready build in the `client/build` directory.

## Step 2: Deploy to Firebase

1. Deploy the application:
```bash
firebase deploy
```

This will deploy:
- Hosting (client application)
- Firestore rules
- Firestore indexes
- Cloud Functions (if any)

## Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. Check the Firebase Console:
   - Verify the deployment was successful
   - Check if all services are running
   - Monitor for any errors

2. Test the deployed application:
   - Visit the deployed URL
   - Test user authentication
   - Verify database operations
   - Check if all features are working

## Step 4: Post-Deployment Tasks

1. Update DNS settings (if using custom domain)
2. Configure SSL certificates
3. Set up monitoring and logging
4. Configure backup strategies

## Production Considerations

### Security
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set
- Verify Firestore security rules
- Check authentication settings
- Enable HTTPS only

### Performance
- Monitor application performance
- Set up caching strategies
- Configure CDN settings
- Optimize asset delivery

### Maintenance
- Set up automated backups
- Configure monitoring alerts
- Plan for regular updates
- Document deployment procedures

## Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check for dependency conflicts
   - Verify Node.js version
   - Review build logs
   - Check environment variables

2. **Deployment Failures**
   - Verify Firebase project configuration
   - Check service quotas
   - Review deployment logs
   - Ensure proper permissions

3. **Runtime Errors**
   - Check Firebase Console logs
   - Monitor application performance
   - Review error tracking
   - Verify database connections

## Rollback Procedures

If you need to rollback a deployment:

1. Identify the last stable version
2. Use Firebase Console to rollback:
```bash
firebase hosting:rollback
```

3. Verify the rollback was successful
4. Document the issue and resolution

## Continuous Deployment

For automated deployments:

1. Set up a CI/CD pipeline
2. Configure deployment triggers
3. Set up automated testing
4. Implement deployment approvals

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Monitor application performance
2. Set up analytics
3. Configure backups
4. Plan for scaling
